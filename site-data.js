// Hello! You're probably here to credit yourself.
// Let me (ZaneDev) show you how
// The list below is how you can add yourself
// First, make sure the person above you has added a comma to their closing bracket (the } symbol)
// If so then you're ready.
// First, add your initals. (e.g. Kevin Kor -> kk, ZaneDev -> zv (I used my last name), Jaked -> jk, etc)
// From here you have a lot of things you can use for describing yourself. I'll list them off
// 
// name -> pretty self explanatory. just use a string containing your name
// initals -> make these your name initals used previously
// pfp -> link to your profile picture (preferably add it to the assets folder)
// url -> link to your website (e.g. zane.org, mgdproductions.com, kevinblog.sytes.net, etc.)
// role -> What you've done in the project. This defaults to "Community Supporter"
// pro -> Your pronouns :D. Use this to tell people your prefered pronouns (e.g. he/him, she/her, they/them, he/they, she/they, they/he/she, etc (there are basically an infinite amount of pronouns))
